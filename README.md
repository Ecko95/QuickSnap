Snap, Edit & Share

QuickSnap is a photo editor that allows you to capture and share your best moments with friends and family.

It enables users to view their phone's multimedia content in a simple gallery style app.
When taking pictures within the app, users are given a wide selection of filters to chose from, as well as the ability to upload their edited pictures to a cloud based storage solution (FireBase).
